    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Ghirardelli brownie mix is ridiculously good, so it's a compliment when I say these brownies remind me of boxed. 
        They rose beautifully in the oven and formed a shiny, crackled top—aka the picture of brownie perfection. 
        If I was judging on looks alone, these brownies would definitely take home top prize.

        This was the only recipe to use melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder, which gave them a chewy-cakey texture that I couldn't get enough of. 
        The substantial amount of salt enhanced their chocolatey flavor, but next time, I'll use bittersweet instead of semisweet chocolate. 
        I also recommend using chopped chocolate rather than chips, which will melt more readily and smoothly.
