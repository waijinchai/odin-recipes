    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Ghirardelli brownie mix is ridiculously good, so it's a compliment when I say these brownies remind me of boxed. 
        They rose beautifully in the oven and formed a shiny, crackled top—aka the picture of brownie perfection. 
        If I was judging on looks alone, these brownies would definitely take home top prize.

    <p>
        This was the only recipe to use melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder, which gave them a chewy-cakey texture that I couldn't get enough of. 
        The substantial amount of salt enhanced their chocolatey flavor, but next time, I'll use bittersweet instead of semisweet chocolate. 
        I also recommend using chopped chocolate rather than chips, which will melt more readily and smoothly.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar, butter, and water in a medium saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until boiling. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate chips until melted and smooth; mix in eggs and vanilla. Combine flour, salt, and baking soda; stir into the chocolate mixture. Spread brownie batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 20 to 30 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
